   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tiny-tracker.git
   cd tiny-tracker
   ```

2. **Add the original repository as upstream**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/originalowner/tiny-tracker.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Verify everything works**
   - Visit http://localhost:8080
   - Navigate between pages
   - Check that tracking events appear in http://localhost:8080/stats

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write code following our coding standards
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user session duration tracking"
   ```

4. **Keep your branch updated**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

- Use **ES6+ features** where appropriate
- Use **const** and **let** instead of **var**
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Keep functions **small and focused**
- Use **async/await** for asynchronous operations

### Code Formatting

```javascript
// Good ‚úÖ
const trackingData = {
    eventType: 'click',
    elementTag: element.tagName.toLowerCase(),
    timestamp: Date.now()
};

// Avoid ‚ùå
var data = {eventType:'click',elementTag:element.tagName.toLowerCase(),timestamp:Date.now()};
```

### Database Changes

- Always include migration logic for schema changes
- Use try/catch blocks for database operations
- Test with existing data to ensure backward compatibility

### Frontend Guidelines

- Keep HTML semantic and accessible
- Use CSS classes over inline styles
- Ensure responsive design principles
- Test across different browsers
